# NLP-WindowsChatAssistant
##This is a small Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing project based on Python.

This is a small project based on Python. It works by recognizing your voice and responding to it . You can search about any random stuff using 
your voice. You must specify the thing you want ot know about by saying "What is 'keyword'". It searches the wikipedia and says and displays the 
first 5 lines. Apart from this, it talks to you normally like you can say 'Hello' and realted stuff.

You can open Windows applications by saying Open followed by the appllication name. For example, if you say open notepad, say "open 'Notepad'" and  
it will open Notepad. 

Note: You will have to change the location of the application (Windows) based on its location on your system, in the python code.
Note: This project has a number of dependencies which you will have to install,like chatterbot etc. You have to install all these
you can use the normal pip install command to do this.
For example, if you have to install chatterbot type :
> pip install chatterbot
